You don't have to worry in this place since nobody can see or hear us here, through the void.
While you were getting tested, we were watching you and were impressed by your abilities.
That's why I'm here, Subject 4513. Generalization Systems would have you believe the System is a feeder, which you don't really have to get out of. We do have other plans about you, Mr. 4513, which... well... I'm not allowed to talk about yet, nevertheless, they are more interesting and nobler, than endless infringement of human rights for the execution of government orders and profit.
Therefore, I think you, as an intelligent freedom-loving man, understand joining us is the only right decision in this situation.

Rest while here, Subject 4513, in the emptiness without the time. Your hour will come again."
