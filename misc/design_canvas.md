## Platform
PC (Windows)
## Gameplay
***Abstraction*** is a first-person physical puzzle game, inspired by [Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)), [Superliminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superliminal), [Plactions](https://rob1221.itch.io/plactions).
*Abstraction* consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by changing player's velocity, creating objects and modifying world properties using actions of PDA (*should we save or replace PDA in the script?*).
There are 4 actions:
1. Superjump (performing an extremely high jump)
2. Dash
3. Materialization (creating a cube, destroying another cube created by the action).
4. Gravity inversion
### Controls
WASD | walk
Space | jump
E | interact, grab a physical object
Left mouse click | Perform an action

## Narrative design
## Backstory
Generalization Systems(1) uploads subjects' consciousnesses to their Abstract System of the Computer Simulation Laboratory(2) - a simulated environment for testing weapons tech and posthuman modifications. ASCSL subjects can test endlessly without risk of actual injury or death - so no matter how many times a subject "dies," the lab can just reset their state.
The system's environment changes to reflect each subject's memories in order to ease them into digital existence and encourage the subjects to act naturally during tests - but the reflection is imperfect, resulting in unusual distorted spaces.
(1) Possible alternate name: Bostrom Labs. Origin: Named after Nick Bostrom, one of the founders of the simulation hypothesis - or a theory that we're all living in a computer simulation.
(2) Possible alternate name: Gestalt Engineering Abstraction System (GEAS). Origin: A "geas" is like a quest, but it's forced upon the hero - referencing how Subject 4513 is forced into this simulation and cannot return.
### Characters
*Subject 4513*: The player character. A Generalization Systems employee that strongly objects to GS' amoral practices; volunteered as a test subject, intending to infiltrate ASCSL to shut it down/corrupt it beyond repair.
*Narrator*: an AI that monitors and annotates Subject's progress.
*N.N.*: An amalgamation of the fragmented consciousnesses of previous test subjects - a literal "ghost in the machine" dwelling within ASCSL.
### Narrative flow
See "Abstraction Narrative Flow.pdf" by @gumbelmachine.
### Cutscenes/scripted sequences
All scripted sequences are first-person and control is never taken away from the player, unless we believe it to be necessary.
